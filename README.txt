# AirPnP
Like AirBnB but for Parking

Hey guys Here is the READme

Sprint 1 “define your product” 
Product description:
	Product Owner = This are some of the ideas that we discussed in class, some of the features that the app must have:
	Allow current location to search for a parking spot (we need to find the way to do this through Xamarin)
	The app will give us some information about the parking spot, how big, location, reviews
	People having parking areas over their houses or apartments who wants to rent temporary 
	A profile user needs to be set up with payment type and host application
	Option to have someone to pick you up and drop you up
	There should be a way to communicate (text box, chat) that the host and the customer can be in communication between themselves.
	Save option for places that we have visited before 
First sprint = On Monday 23th we are going to set up the back log and determine what needs to be accomplished. 
For the moment we have decided to use Xamarin as a tool de develop the app
